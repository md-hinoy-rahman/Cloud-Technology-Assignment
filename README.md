## Description:
This project aims to leverage PySpark's powerful capabilities for big data processing to develop an interactive visualization app. The app provides insights into the relationship between mean annual salaries and the cost of living index across different countries. By analyzing a large dataset, the project identifies trends, patterns, and correlations to answer whether higher living costs correlate with higher earnings.

## Tools Used:
- PySpark
- Google Colab
- Google Drive
- Pandas
- Tableau
- Power BI
- Python Libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Pipeline:
1. **Data Acquisition**: Gathered a large dataset containing information on country, continent, job title, mean annual salary, and cost of living index.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned the dataset using Google Colab and Pandas to handle missing values and standardize formats.
3. **Data Extraction**: Extracted necessary information such as country, job title, mean annual salary, and cost of living index.
4. **Data Transformation**: Grouped data by country and calculated average mean annual salary and cost of living index.
5. **Data Visualization**: Created an interactive scatter plot using PySpark to visualize the relationship between the cost of living index and average mean annual salary, enabling comparisons across multiple countries.
6. **Analysis**: Conducted statistical and mathematical analysis to determine which countries offer better living conditions based on the ratio between salary and cost of living index.
